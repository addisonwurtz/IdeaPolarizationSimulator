# Feature Brainstorm:

- animation/model for single idea propagation
- animation/model for competeing idea propagation
- animation/model for multi idea propagation
- adjustable ideological weights/extremism factor
- adjustable "transmissability"
- adjustable distribution of pre-existing bias throughout the population
- color gradient to represent ideological orientation of individuals in population (that changes as ideas with different ideological weights are propagated)
- different models for idea propagation based on current research models (based on wildfires, epidemics, etc.)
- adjustable simulation length
- adjustable population size
